# JanetMinesweeper

Makes it easy to send minesweeper fields to the r/jailbreak Discord server by abusing Janet the Discord bot

## History

This repository was created back when Janet the Discord bot was still being used in the r/jailbreak Discord server. The bot had a problem which made it possible to send any message using the bot. This didn't have any major implications, it just made it possible to bypass filters. One of the filters that can be bypassed this way is the spoiler filter. This repository contains a small script that lets you generate a Janet command which will make the bot send a small Minesweeper game with spoiler tags.
